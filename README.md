# Geometric Learning Using Graph Laplacian and Dynamic Laplacian method
## Abstract
The following work is focusing on understanding the geometry of transport by using Diffusion maps for Lagrangian trajectory unravel coherent sets. The work will try to reconstruct the results from \cite{Banisch_2017} with the two different datasets. The first one is the Double Gyre dynamic system and the second one is the Bickley Jet flow regime. The innovative of this approach is to determine a coherent sets from possibly sparse Lagrangian trajectory data. In addition, the method expand the idea of diffusion map not only for the space domain but also for the time domain and create connectivity between space and time, thus creating "dynamic coordinates", which reveal the intrinsic low-dimensional organization of the data with respect to transport.
